    // Notes:
    // Similarities 
    // Both can be used to change local variables of one function inside another function. 
    // Both of them can also be used to save copying of big objects when passed as arguments to functions or returned from functions.

    // Differences:
    // Once a reference is created, it cannot be later made to reference another object; it cannot be reseated. 
    // References cannot be NULL. Pointers are often made NULL to indicate that they are not pointing to any valid thing.
        // A pointer can be declared as void but a reference can never be void: void &a = x; // Not valid
    // A reference must be initialized when declared. There is no such restriction with pointers
